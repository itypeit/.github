# What's itypeit?

itypeit is a cli tool that scans any backend project to generate typescript types for its api. It's intented to be used by developers who want to interact with non-typescript backends in a type safe way. It's ideal to use with backend frameworks that have clear conventions for defining models.

## Roadmap:

itypeit currently supports generating types from backend projects written in:

- [ ] Laravel (php)
- [ ] Rocket (rust)
- [ ] Django (python)
